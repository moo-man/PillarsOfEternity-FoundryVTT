A character who is hit by the Guard is immediately moved back into the hex they came from. A character who is charging or running takes double damage and is automatically Knocked Down (this includes mounted characters and their mounts) as well as moved back. Characters who are already in range of the Guard are free to ignore it.",

All subsequent instances of damage Always Hit with no chance of Crit, i.e., they do the listed damage to everyone passing through it.",
    "PILLARS.SpecialDescription.Snapshot": "In the first round of a character's combat, if this weapon is already loaded and in hand, it can be fired before the Move phase. Characters perform Snapshots in standard Initiative order. Additionally, Snapshot makes the Standard Attack of this weapon an Immediate instead of an Action.",
    "PILLARS.SpecialDescription.SplitShield": "Attack the target’s Deflection, but a shield’s contribution reduces their Deflection instead of increasing it. Damage is done directly to the shield and may exceed the listed Shield Soak.",
